title: "Prettier 3.7: Improved formatting consistency and new plugin features!"
---

This release brings over 65 bug fixes and formatting improvements across JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, and other languages. We've focused on making Prettier's output more consistent across different parsers and edge cases, while also adding new plugin capabilities for better extensibility.

Key improvements include:
- More consistent formatting for JavaScript and TypeScript code across different parsers
- Better handling of comments in various contexts
- Improved CSS formatting, particularly for comma-separated values and comments
- Enhanced plugin API with new `printPrettierIgnored()` and `estree` printer support
- Multiple fixes for Angular, Handlebars, Markdown, and other languages

We want to thank all the contributors who made this release possible. Your bug reports, pull requests, and feedback help make Prettier better for everyone!
